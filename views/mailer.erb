Hello you wonderful person! <3

Thank you for doing the shift this week!

Someone reported a case via our website. This is the information they put in:


<% fields.each do |key, value| %>
    <% if value != "" then %>- <%= key %>: <%= value %><% end %>

<% end %>

If there is anything wrong or strange with this e-mail, please report it to our #webpage slack-channel!

Love,

your briefkasten :)




<%= fields['first_name_v'] %>

<%= fields['last_name_v'] %>

<%= fields['age_v'] %>
